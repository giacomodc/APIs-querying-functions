# APIs querying functions
List of R functions I wrote for querying different Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

APIs:
* [Google Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/intro)
*  [Seattle Department of Transportation - paid parking occupancy data](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/2018-Paid-Parking-Occupancy-Year-to-date-/6yaw-2m8q)
